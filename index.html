            <p class="para">We live in a world where identities are often written by others—by colonial laws, institutional archives, and societal silence. For South Asian gender-diverse communities like hijras, kinnars, and khwaja siras, this isn’t just metaphorical. It's history.<br>
                <br> British colonial rule in South Asia did more than govern land—it reshaped how people understood themselves and each other. Gender-diverse communities were broadly grouped under the label “eunuchs,” a term that erased the complex cultural and spiritual roles these communities had long held. Colonial laws, such as the Criminal Tribes Act, criminalized their presence, pathologized their identities, and tried to erase them from public life altogether (Dutta, 2012; Hinchy, 2014).<br>
                <br> Even today, the language we use to talk about gender-diverse people in South Asia is often filtered through Western frameworks. Take the term transgender, for example—although it’s been part of Western discourse for decades, it only began being applied to South Asian contexts in the 1990s, mainly through HIV/AIDS NGOs and LGBTQ+ activism (Roy, 2016). This translation, while politically strategic in some ways, can also collapse distinct histories, rituals, and identities into one globally legible (but often inaccurate) term and create a “collective category of identity,” as Jules Gill-Peterson (2024) states.</p>
