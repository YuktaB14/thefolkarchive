        <div class="introduction">
            <p class="para">We live in a world where identities are often written by others—by colonial laws, institutional archives, and societal silence. For South Asian gender-diverse communities like hijras, kinnars, and khwaja siras, this isn’t just metaphorical. It's history.<br>
                <br> British colonial rule in South Asia did more than govern land—it reshaped how people understood themselves and each other. Gender-diverse communities were broadly grouped under the label “eunuchs,” a term that erased the complex cultural and spiritual roles these communities had long held. Colonial laws, such as the Criminal Tribes Act, criminalized their presence, pathologized their identities, and tried to erase them from public life altogether (Dutta, 2012; Hinchy, 2014).<br>
                <br> Even today, the language we use to talk about gender-diverse people in South Asia is often filtered through Western frameworks. Take the term transgender, for example—although it’s been part of Western discourse for decades, it only began being applied to South Asian contexts in the 1990s, mainly through HIV/AIDS NGOs and LGBTQ+ activism (Roy, 2016). This translation, while politically strategic in some ways, can also collapse distinct histories, rituals, and identities into one globally legible (but often inaccurate) term and create a “collective category of identity,” as Jules Gill-Peterson (2024) states.</p>

        <div class="row justify-content-center">
            <p class="para">I want to begin by acknowledging my own positionality: I approach this project as an outsider to South Asian trans communities. While I share regional and cultural ties, I do not claim lived experience within these identities. My role here is not to speak for these communities, but to think critically about how history and knowledge production have impacted them—and how we might turn to alternative forms of knowledge to recover what’s been erased.
                <br><br>This blog explores how folk epistemologies—community-rooted ways of knowing grounded in oral histories, myths, rituals, and embodied traditions—can challenge the dominance of Western academic frameworks and acts as an example for the same. These alternative epistemologies don’t just preserve history; they resist ongoing erasure. They offer us ways of seeing and understanding gender variance rooted in place, time, and community—not in colonial categories.

        <h2>But Why Folk Epistemologies?</h2>
        <div class="row justify-content-center">
            <p class="para">By centering folk knowledge, we can recover gender-diverse histories in South Asia and disrupt the long-standing dominance of Western epistemic authority. It’s not just about telling different stories—it’s about telling stories differently.
                <br><br>Folk epistemologies are essential in order to make space for gender-diverse identities that exist outside Euro-American frameworks. Within academic discourse, trans studies remain dominated by Northern epistemes that often fail to engage meaningfully with South Asian perspectives (Radi, 2019). This oversight is not neutral; it constitutes an act of epistemic violence that privileges Western modes of knowing while marginalizing Indigenous understandings of gender and sexuality (Spivak, 2016). Archival methods that prioritize textual sources over oral, ritualistic, or embodied forms of knowledge further entrench colonial hierarchies of legitimacy. instead there rises importance to the project of provincialising knowledge systems .
                <br><br>In contrast, folk epistemologies offer alternative knowledge systems rooted in lived experience, spirituality, and community memory. These epistemologies rely heavily on narratives, myths, and oral histories to explain and legitimize identities (Radi, 2019; Loh, 2014), often linking contemporary gender variance to ancient and sacred traditions. In doing so, they actively counter dominant societal discourses that position non-normative gender identities as 'deviant' (Hinchy, 2014; Loh, 2014). Crucially, these narratives are not static; they are continuously reinterpreted and mobilized by community members to assert their legitimacy and challenge derogatory stereotypes (Loh, 2014). Folk epistemologies thus resist what Billard and Nesfield (2020) call "cultural imperialism," maintaining and reasserting pre-colonial or non-Western frameworks for understanding gender variance.
                <br><br>A critical regional approach rooted in folk epistemologies centers on community-based knowledge to counter exclusion. Gender-diverse identities are shaped by movement, history, language, and local context. For example, hijras in West Bengal and Bangladesh share linguistic and ritual ties. In contrast, hijras in Pakistan and Rajasthan reflect distinct religious affiliations. Ethnographies show Indian hijras often adopt Islam despite Hindu origins, Bangladeshi hijras revere the Hindu goddess Maya Ji, while Pakistani hijras typically align solely with Islam (Hossain, 2018).

        <div class="row justify-content-center">
            <p class="para">Such examples challenge homogenizing frameworks and reveal the inadequacy of Euro-American queer theory to account for regional specificity. As Hossain (2018) argues, a critical regional lens enables non-teleological readings of gender and sexuality that resist the flattening impulses of Western theory. It also addresses the persistent issue of representation—wherein Western intellectuals often speak for the subaltern, thereby reinforcing the very colonial power structures they claim to critique (Spivak, 2016). Provincialising queer and trans studies through the incorporation of folk epistemologies is thus not only a methodological intervention but also an ethical imperative.

        <h2>Gender Diverse Identities Before the British</h2>

        <div class="row justify-content-center">
            <p class="para">A close look at premodern South Asian texts, traditions, and social structures reveals that gender diversity was not marginal—it was embedded in language, ritual, and narrative. Individuals who did not conform to the male-female binary were recognized through culturally legible roles and discursive categories, rather than being pathologized or erased.

                <br><br>Language offers a powerful lens into this epistemology. The Sanskrit term napumsaka (नपुंसक), meaning “neither man nor woman,” appears in ancient legal and medical texts, marking a conceptual space beyond binary gender. As Ruth Vanita and Saleem Kidwai note, its use in the Sushruta Samhita refers to individuals with varied sexualities and bodily traits, revealing an early understanding of gender as contingent and embodied (Vanita, 2000; Vanita, 2002). Here, identity is read through a spectrum of physical and social cues—not reduced to fixed binaries.
                
                <br><br>Social roles further affirmed this diversity. Historical records show gender-variant individuals served as temple dancers, ritual specialists, and court attendants—positions that were not only visible but institutionally sanctioned (Jaffrey, 1996). These roles point to a social production of gender rooted in ritual and performance.
                
                <br><br>Myth and religious narratives also legitimize gender fluidity. Deities like Ardhanarishvara and Vishnu’s incarnation as Mohini complicate binary logics, casting transformation as spiritually potent (Pattanaik, 2001). Similarly, epic characters like Shikhandi—assigned female at birth but accepted as male in the Mahabharata—showcase how gender was understood as performative and relational (Ganguli, n.d.; Vanita, 2002).

            <p class="para">
                <br>Devotional and performance traditions continued this line. In the Ramanandi order, male devotees (rasiks or sakhis) adopted feminine expressions of devotion, blurring lines between gender and spirituality. Nineteenth-century theater embraced female impersonation, allowing for culturally intelligible modes of gender crossing—even if their subversive potential remains debated (Hinchy, 2014).
                
                <br><br>Communities like hijras and khwajasarais were part of these discursive and institutional worlds. Hijras’ ritual roles echoed older devotional practices, while khwajasarais held powerful state positions—as courtiers, diplomats, and military officials (Hinchy, 2014). Their presence illustrates a sociopolitical order where gender variance was not an exception, but integral to cultural functioning.
                
                <br><br>Taken together, these linguistic, mythological, and performative representations disrupt the idea that gender fluidity is a modern or Western invention. They offer a precolonial South Asian framework in which gender was fluid, embodied, and contextually shaped—anchored not just in bodies, but in language, ritual, and genre.

        <h2>The Colonial Empire and it Enduring Epistemic Voilence</h2>

        <div class="row justify-content-center">
            <p class="para">
                To 19th-century British officials, hijras were not just different—they were dangerous. Labeled as “habitual sodomites,” their performances were deemed obscene, and their public presence considered a “moral outrage” (Hinchy, 2014). Gender-diverse communities such as hijras, khwaja saras, and kinnars were forcibly rewritten in colonial records as “eunuchs”—a term saturated with racial, sexual, and moral panic. This reclassification was not simply semantic; it was a deliberate attempt to discipline non-normative bodies through language, surveillance, and law.
                <br><br>Although many within these communities identified as “neither males nor females,” colonial authorities collapsed their identities into a Western gender binary, referring to them simply as “men.” This erasure transformed culturally embedded and spiritually significant figures into social outcasts, reducing them from respected community members to criminals (Hinchy, 2014).
                <br><br>This epistemic violence found material form in laws like the Criminal Tribes Act (CTA) of 1871, which included a specific clause targeting “eunuchs.” Under this legislation, anyone who “appeared, dressed or ornamented like a woman,” or who danced, sang, or participated in public performances, could be criminalized—despite these being central to the communities’ livelihood and ritual practices (Governor General of India, 1871).

            <p class="para">
                More insidiously, the law sought the eventual extinction of gender-diverse communities. By outlawing emasculation, colonial authorities hoped to ensure that eunuchs would “die out,” treating gender variance as a contaminant that could be sterilized and eradicated (Hinchy, 2014).
                <br><br>Colonial archives reflect a deep anxiety around contamination—both moral and physical. British officials imagined hijras as carriers of degeneracy. In the 1850s, police reports documented campaigns to “cleanse” public spaces of hijras, echoing sanitary drives against disease (North-Western Provinces Nizamut Adawlut, 1852; Drummond, 1865). Their mere presence was viewed as a threat to the moral hygiene of the Empire.
                <br><br>Hijra performances—rich with cultural and spiritual meaning—were deliberately misread as sexual solicitation. As Griffin (1870) noted, these acts were interpreted not as expressions of identity or tradition, but as advertisements for sex work. This flattening of meaning helped justify their legal persecution. One Inspector-General wrote: “[s]o long as these creatures are allowed to go about singing and dancing in women’s clothes, [sodomy] will not be put a stop to” (Tyrwhitt, 1874).
                <br><br>Coloniality never left. The narratives forged under British rule—equating gender variance with deviance, criminality, and immorality—persist in postcolonial South Asia. Far from neutral, the colonial archive played an active role in constructing the very realities it claimed to record.
                <br><br>During the colonial period, a rising South Asian middle class began to define itself through ideas of ‘tradition,’ even as it was shaped by Western-style education. The divide between colonizer and colonized was far more entangled than elite nationalist discourses would admit. These elites often echoed colonial anxieties, viewing hijras in public spaces as immoral or indecent. Though nationalism claimed to assert an Eastern identity in contrast to the West, it remained deeply shaped by Enlightenment logics and colonial epistemologies (Gichki, 2020).
                <br><br>Ironically, post-independence reconfigurations of sexuality in India and Pakistan bore a closer resemblance to Victorian norms than indigenous ones. As Gichki (2020) observes, both states reconstituted sexual morality in ways that mirrored colonial-era ideals rather than resisting them.

        <div class="row justify-content-center">
            <p class="para">
                Hijras in South Asia have long resisted colonial erasure through embodied practices like performance, oral storytelling, and ritual. These modes of expression—often misrepresented or criminalized in colonial archives—offered powerful ways to assert identity, community, and spiritual authority (Hinchy, 2014; Pamment, 2019a).

                <br>Central to this resistance were traditional badhai performances at births and weddings, which provided both income and izzat (community respect). These acts were more than ceremonial—they publicly challenged colonial norms and reclaimed visibility (Pamment, 2019b). In markets and religious fairs, Hijras used their presence and performances, often condemned as “obscene,” to disrupt colonial ideals of masculinity and public decorum (Hinchy, 2014; Hinchy, 2022).
                <br><br>One such embodied act is the distinctive flat-palmed clap, still taught to new initiates. Far from a simple gesture, it functions as a spatial and sonic assertion of existence—an identity marker historically grounded in resistance, even as it faces stigma from some contemporary activists. Khwaja siras also perform in Sufi shrines, where Islam shapes their practices. These performances in shrines can be seen as displays of piety.  (Hinchy, 2022; Hossain, 2018; Roy, 2019).

These groups often trade devalued ways of encoding hijra difference for modern ones based on middle-class respectability and a transgender lexicon of self-understanding, or pehchān (acknowledgement of the self, or ‘identity’) (Roy, 2019).

                    Oral traditions played a vital role in preserving collective memory. In lieu of formal education, narrative became a tool to transmit history, reframe deviance, and draw upon ancient texts and mythologies to legitimize non-binary gender roles (Khan, 2016; Loh, 2014). By recounting these stories to researchers, Hijras actively shaped their representation—rejecting colonial definitions in favor of lived knowledge and ancestral continuity.

                Even everyday practices like alms-collection became acts of resistance. Framed by colonial law as criminal, these rituals affirmed Hijras’ spiritual power and subverted authority through the threat of "bawdy talk" or cursing when denied (Hinchy, 2014). In doing so, they carved out space—both physical and symbolic—against systemic attempts to render them invisible.

            <p class="para">
                The colonial archive, rooted in European epistemologies, sought to categorize and control Hijras, yet gender-variant communities persisted through oral traditions and performative practices that defied official records. Their everyday acts of evasion, negotiation, and use of "cracks" in colonial authority exemplify infra-politics—subtle, subversive forms of resistance beneath formal governance. The survival of these communities, despite efforts to erase them, underscores both the limits of colonial power and their enduring resilience. Contemporary activism, including protests against police violence, draws strength from this legacy of performance and solidarity, challenging ongoing marginalization rooted in colonial narratives. Scholars should continue to critique the archive’s distortions and silences, emphasizing the importance of oral histories and performance cultures in reclaiming erased identities and articulating more complex modes of resistance.
